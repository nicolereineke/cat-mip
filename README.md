Consortium for AI Terminology for MSPs &amp; IT Pros (CAT-MIP)

Mission Statement: To define a shared vocabulary for AI Agents operating across MSP and IT Pro platforms to ensure interoperability, transparency, and reliability.
AI Agents communicate using natural language, just like we do. But in a technical environment, that introduces challenges. One user might type “device,” another might say “asset,” “endpoint,” or “laptop.” These can all mean the same thing... or not. And as these AI Agents pass instructions from one system to another, across different companies and platforms, the risk of misinterpretation increases.

To ensure these AI Agents execute the right actions, every time, we need to align on a shared language. That’s why we’re creating a structured dictionary and relationship model (lightweight ontology) tailored specifically to the MSP and IT Pro world.

This lightweight but powerful framework lets us:

Standardize how we refer to infrastructure, services, and tools across our ecosystem
Help AI Agents understand the relationships between devices, policies, tenants, and actions
Improve accuracy when automating complex tasks across environments
Prepare our platform and our partners for a future of autonomous service delivery
By leading the creation of this MSP and IT Pro specific terminology standard, we’re ensuring that our AI Agents, and the tools they interact with, speak the same language. It’s a foundational step toward smarter, more secure, and more efficient IT operations.
