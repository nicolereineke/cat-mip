Consortium for AI Terminology for MSPs &amp; IT Pros (CAT-MIP)

Mission Statement: To define a shared vocabulary for AI Agents operating across MSP and IT Pro platforms to ensure interoperability, transparency, and reliability.
AI Agents communicate using natural language, just like we do. But in a technical environment, that introduces challenges. One user might type “device,” another might say “asset,” “endpoint,” or “laptop.” These can all mean the same thing... or not. And as these AI Agents pass instructions from one system to another, across different companies and platforms, the risk of misinterpretation increases.

To ensure these AI Agents execute the right actions, every time, we need to align on a shared language. That’s why we’re creating a structured dictionary and relationship model (lightweight ontology) tailored specifically to the MSP and IT Pro world.

This lightweight but powerful framework lets us:

Standardize how we refer to infrastructure, services, and tools across our ecosystem
Help AI Agents understand the relationships between devices, policies, tenants, and actions
Improve accuracy when automating complex tasks across environments
Prepare our platform and our partners for a future of autonomous service delivery
By leading the creation of this MSP and IT Pro specific terminology standard, we’re ensuring that our AI Agents, and the tools they interact with, speak the same language. It’s a foundational step toward smarter, more secure, and more efficient IT operations.

# Development Status
This project is community-driven and in the early stages of development. The goal is to define and maintain a shared vocabulary and relationship model (lightweight ontology) for AI Agents operating across MSP and IT Pro platforms.

See the project overview discussion for scope, goals, and active work.

# Contributing
Discussions: Propose and refine new terminology, definitions, and relationships.

Issues: Track well-scoped technical or vocabulary work agreed upon by the community.

Pull Requests: Submit new or updated vocabulary entries, relationship mappings, or schema changes.

# Overview
The CAT-MIP Registry is a centralized repository for standardized terms, synonyms, and relationships used by AI Agents in MSP and IT Pro environments.
It simplifies interoperability between AI Agents, systems, and tools by ensuring that prompts, instructions, and automated actions map to the same canonical meaning.

# Features
JSON CAT-MIP vocabulary entries 

Synonyms to map multiple terms to a single canonical definition

Relationship modeling to describe how objects interact (e.g., Asset belongsTo Tenant)

Prompt examples for consistent AI interpretation

Agent execution guidance for accurate action mapping

Metadata for tracing and transparency

# Getting Started
# Workflow Overview
Request Flow Example: "Restart all devices at the Denver client that missed patches"

Technician Prompt — Natural language request.

LLM Host + CAT-MIP Mapping — Maps “devices” → Asset, “client” → Tenant, “missed patches” → compliance filter.

MCP Tool Call — Uses canonical CAT-MIP terms.

MCP Server — Validates tenant scope, injects security headers, translates to RMM API format.

RMM API Response — Returns list of matching assets.

Execute Actions — Restarts each asset using restart_asset.

Success Response — Human-readable confirmation using CAT-MIP terminology.
